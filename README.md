This code is about simulating a sky catalogue, following the next steps

1 - Stars should have randomized sky positions around the Andromeda galaxy
2 - Positions should fall within 1 degree of the central location
3 - Each star should have a unique ID
4 - The star ID and position should be saved in a csv file to be analyzed by other programs
